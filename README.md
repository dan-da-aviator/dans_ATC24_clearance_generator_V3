## Introduction
Dan's ATC24 Clearance Generator is a software designed to ensure maximum efficiency when controlling on ATC24. Instead of manually having to piece together a clearance for an aircraft on ATC24, you can do it in an unbelievably structured style using the Clearance Generator V3. The software works by assigning SID and vector data based off the destination, so for example you have an aircraft looking to fly to Perth from Greater Rockford: the software will choose a SID or a vector that turns in the Northerly direction.
Over the past few months, this software has became increasingly quick at helping controllers clear aircraft, especially with our built in PDC generator.

## Main Features
- Accurate information on SID's and radar vectors making sure that aircraft safely depart from your airport
- Unbelievably high levels of adaptability, supported over 9 airports using all runways
- Extremely customizable: Enter custom values to make sure your clearance system stays structured
- Built-in Pre Departure Clearance Generator allowing you to keep transmissions to the minimum
- Copy & paste availability: Allows you to quickly copy and past values over into 24Scope to make sure you stay up to date

For information on how to use, check out the instructions files that guide you through using both normal entries, as well as custom entries.
